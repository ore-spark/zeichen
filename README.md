(Growl/Toast/whatever you want to call fixed position browser notices/messages really)-like plugin for browser message popups. Supports fun things like action callbacks on messages, fun css3 animations, customization of everything from the html templates used to the css prefixes for each element. Dead simple to use, perhaps a little bit ridiculous in the sense of config options.
